[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/morloderex/batchedPusherChannels.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/morloderex/batchedPusherChannels)

* [Installation](#installation)

This package allows batch the authentication requests from pusher in one request using [Dirk Bonhomme](https://github.com/dirkbonhomme/pusher-js-auth) authorizor plugin.

Once installed you will see authorization requests towards your channels in batches.

## Installation

This package can be used in Laravel 5.5 or higher.

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require morloderex/batched-pusher-channels
```

In Laravel 5.5 the service provider will automatically get registered. In older versions of the framework just add the service provider in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Morloderex\PusherBatch\Providers\BatchedPusherProvider::class,
];
```

## Change your broadcast provider

Once installed through composer by the require command. You then change the BROADCAST_PROVIDER environment variable to be ```BatchedPusher```

And you should be all set.

### Testing
